Short answer: yes—your repo has a complete, sane pipeline for building FGM tables for FGMFoam, and the “ldm” script you included is the one that matches what we worked toward (the nested LDM-table layout without `dimensions`). Here’s how it all fits together and what “ldm tables” are.

# The procedure (end-to-end)

1. **Generate flamelets.**
   Run counter-flow diffusion flamelets across a strain sweep with Cantera; each step saves `strain_loop_XX.yaml/csv`. You control fuel/air, transport model, recentering, etc. 

2. **Postprocess each flamelet to point data.**
   Compute mixture fraction **Z**, progress variable **PV**, χ_Z proxy, stretch rate, ρ, T and species, writing `post_strain_loop_XX.csv`. 

3. **Bin to 2-D (Z×PV) tables.**
   Favre-average onto regular grids and emit `axes/Z.csv`, `axes/PV.csv`, `thermo/T.csv`, `thermo/rho.csv`, and `species/Y_<name>.csv` as `02_tables/` (or `02_tables.tar.xz`). 

4. **(Utility) Convert CSV bundle to OpenFOAM dictionaries (optional).**
   `csv2of_tables.py` writes `constant/tables/*_table` **with** `dimensions` and also creates `constant/tableProperties` and `constant/PVtableProperties`. It can optionally compute `mu/Cps/alpha/psi` via Cantera or add `PVmin/PVmax/SourcePV`. This step is mainly to seed `tableProperties` and for solvers that accept simple 2-D tables. 

5. **Write FGMFoam’s “LDM tables”.**
   `ldm_from_02tables_nodim.py` reads `02_tables` **and** your `constant/tableProperties` / `PVtableProperties`, then writes nested LDM-format files (no `dimensions` blocks) at your chosen `tablePath` (e.g., `constant/table/`). Defaults cover `T`, `rho`, **all** `Y_*`, plus zero-filled placeholders like `SourcePV`, `YWI`, `YuWI`, `YbWI`, and the PV line tables `PVmin/PVmax` (and optional `Yu2I/YuYbI/Yb2I`). 

The README in your repo lists exactly this flow with example commands. 

# What are “LDM tables”?

They’re the **nested OpenFOAM dictionary layout** used by FGMFoam’s LDMTable reader: a hierarchy that reflects `(varPV → PV → varZ → Z)` with explicit counts and parenthesized lists—but **without** OpenFOAM `dimensions` entries. Your `ldm_from_02tables_nodim.py` writes that nested structure, sourcing `Z_param/PV_param/varZ_param/varPV_param` from `tableProperties` so the shapes line up with your solver’s expectations. 

# Is this the right LDM script?

**Yes.** The script named `ldm_from_02tables_nodim.py` is the one we want—it emits the LDM nested tables **without** `dimensions` and with the filename conventions (`T_table`, `rho_table`, `Y_<name>_table`, etc.) that FGMFoam typically expects. It also emits the common zero-filled extras many FGM setups reference. 

# Is the other LDM script “wrong”?

The *wrong* thing for FGMFoam’s LDM reader is to feed it the **flat** grid dictionaries that include `axes/size/data` and `dimensions` (what `csv2of_tables.py` produces). Those are fine for other OpenFOAM consumers, and `csv2of_tables.py` is still useful to **write `tableProperties`** and optional thermo extras—but for FGMFoam’s LDM path you should rely on `ldm_from_02tables_nodim.py` for the final tables. 

# Quick sanity checklist

* After step 4, verify `constant/tableProperties` and `constant/PVtableProperties` exist; the `Z_param/PV_param` lengths must match the `Z.csv/PV.csv` grids you built. 
* After step 5, confirm `constant/table/` contains `T_table`, `rho_table`, and `Y_<species>_table` files with nested counts and **no** `dimensions` blocks. 
* If your case uses those “WI”/“uI/bI” weights, keep the zero tables; otherwise you can drop them by trimming `--emit`. 

If you want, I can also sketch the exact commands using your current filenames and a target case path.
